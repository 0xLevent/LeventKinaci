Hi there 👋 I'm Levent

About me 💯
🔭 I'm currently working on what's next.
🔧 My day job is running an AI data company called DAITA Technologies as its Founder and CEO.
👨‍💻 To keep things interesting, I'm also a Blockchain Consultant at Apps with love and elementum, as well as a Product Advisor at Lossless.
➕ Previously, I founded Alethena, a company pioneering Ethereum-based tokenised shares and their trading via an automated market maker in Switzerland.
🎓 I hold a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich).
❤️ Generally, I'm truly passionate about Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Ethereum Smart Contracts, Bitcoin, and OSS Engineering.
📫 How to reach me: pascal.caversaccio@hotmail.ch.
🏠 Where I'm at home: I'm proudly based in Berne, Switzerland.
🌱 I'm currently learning not to go insane – broadly speaking.
💬 Ask me about anything – maybe I can help you; most likely not.
⚡ Fun fact: It took less code to send a man to the moon than to run a smartphone.
