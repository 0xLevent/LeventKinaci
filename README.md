About me 💯

🔭 I'm currently working on what's next.

🔧 My day job is running an AI data company called DAITA Technologies as its Founder and CEO.

👨‍💻 To keep things interesting, I'm also a Blockchain Consultant at Apps with love and elementum, as well as a Product Advisor at Lossless.


🎓 I hold a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich).

❤️ Generally, I'm truly passionate about Machine/Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Ethereum Smart Contracts, Bitcoin, and OSS Engineering.

📫 How to reach me: lvtknc@gmail.com

🏠 Where I'm at home: I'm proudly based in Ankara, Turkey.

🌱 I'm currently learning not to go insane – broadly speaking.

💬 Ask me about anything – maybe I can help you; most likely not.

⚡ Fun fact: It took less code to send a man to the moon than to run a smartphone.
